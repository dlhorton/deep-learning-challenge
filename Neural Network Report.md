# Alphabet Soup Funding Success Prediction

## Overview of the Analysis
Alphabet Soup, a nonprofit foundation, requires a tool to help select funding applicants most likely to succeed in their ventures. Utilizing machine learning and neural networks, a binary classifier was developed to predict the success of these applicants based on data provided by Alphabet Soupâ€™s business team. The dataset comprises over 34,000 organizations that have previously received funding, encompassing various metadata attributes.

### Data Description
- **EIN and NAME:** Identification columns
- **APPLICATION_TYPE:** Type of application submitted to Alphabet Soup
- **AFFILIATION:** Affiliated sector of industry
- **CLASSIFICATION:** Government organization classification
- **USE_CASE:** Use case for funding
- **ORGANIZATION:** Type of organization
- **STATUS:** Current active status
- **INCOME_AMT:** Income classification of the organization
- **SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS:** Any special considerations in the application
- **ASK_AMT:** Amount of funding requested
- **IS_SUCCESSFUL:** Effectiveness of the funding received

## Results

### Data Preprocessing
- **Target Variable:** `IS_SUCCESSFUL`
- **Feature Variables:** `APPLICATION_TYPE`, `AFFILIATION`, `CLASSIFICATION`, `USE_CASE`, `ORGANIZATION`, `STATUS`, `INCOME_AMT`, `SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS`, `ASK_AMT`
- **Removed Variables:** `EIN`, `NAME` (as they are identifiers not contributing to the prediction)

### Model Architecture and Performance
The neural network model included multiple layers with varying neurons and activation functions:
- **Neurons and Layers:** Configured with several layers and neurons to optimize learning.
- **Activation Functions:** Used to enhance non-linear learning capabilities in the network.

Despite efforts to refine the model through architectural adjustments and activation function experimentation, the model did not achieve the target performance of 75% accuracy, with the highest accuracy plateauing at 73%.

### Optimization Attempts
- **Additional Layers:** Introduced an extra layer with 10 units to deepen the network.
- **Activation Adjustments:** Experimented with a linear activation function in the output layer to vary response dynamics.

## Summary
The deep learning model developed to predict the success of funding applications achieved a maximum accuracy of 73%, falling short of the 75% target. Despite several optimization strategies, further improvements in model accuracy were not realized. Future efforts might focus on exploring alternative modeling techniques, incorporating more diverse data features, or employing advanced machine learning algorithms to enhance predictive accuracy.
